# Integrated Help Desk System | PT Bakti Timah Medika 🏥💻

**PT Bakti Timah Medika** is a healthcare company managing 4 hospitals and 7 clinics across the Bangka Belitung Province. To enhance internal service efficiency and communication, I developed a **web-based Help Desk system** that centralizes and streamlines service requests from all departments, with a particular focus on IT and General Affairs (GA) teams.

## Overview 🚀

The **Integrated Help Desk System** allows PT Bakti Timah Medika's internal teams to efficiently manage, track, and resolve service requests. By eliminating unstructured communication methods (such as email and WhatsApp), the system provides a structured, ticket-based approach that ensures traceability and accountability. The platform utilizes a **Kanban method** for task management, ensuring seamless workflows and task prioritization.

## Key Features 🔑

* **Task Management with Kanban**: Organize service requests using a Kanban board for easy tracking and management of tasks.
* **Ticket-Based System**: Replaced emails and WhatsApp messages with a structured ticketing system, ensuring every request is traceable and manageable.
* **Ticket Categorization & Assignment**: Categorized tickets into different service types and assigned them to appropriate teams for faster resolution.
* **Deadline Management**: Added features to set and track deadlines for tasks, improving task prioritization and on-time resolution.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

* **Backend**: CodeIgniter 3
* **Frontend**: AJAX for dynamic and seamless user interaction
* **Database**: MySQL for structured and secure data management

## Key Responsibilities 👨‍💻

* **System Design & Implementation**: Designed and implemented the task management system using the Kanban method, tailored for service request management.
* **Backend Development**: Developed the backend using **CodeIgniter 3** and ensured smooth integration with the frontend using **AJAX**.
* **Feature Development**: Created features for ticket categorization, assignment workflows, and deadline management to enhance task distribution and resolution efficiency.
* **User Interface**: Optimized the user experience to ensure better navigation and faster issue resolution for IT and GA teams.
